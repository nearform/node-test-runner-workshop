- Open the file `src/index.js`.

- There are 3 functions `sum`, `average` and `product` from the previous exercise.

- The test folder is in a custom location `test-folder-custom`.

- Run in the terminal `node --test`.

- It's not executing any test because it can't find our custom location.

- Watch the file `./test-folder-custom/index.spec.js` has the `.spec`
  extension that the test runner does not recognize.

- There are 3 simple test names after the functions we want to test.

- We want to run only the test that contains the name `product`.

- ðŸ’¡ When running `node --test` use the flag `--test-name-pattern` and specificy the folder and extension file.
